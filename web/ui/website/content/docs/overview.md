# What is Convoy?

Convoy is a fast & secure webhooks service. It receives event data from a HTTP API and sends these event data to the configured endpoints.

## Glossary

This section collects brief definitions of some of the technical terms used in the documentation for Convoy.

### Applications

An application represents a user's application trying to receive webhooks. Once you create an application on Convoy. You receive an `app_id` that you should save and supply in subsequent API calls to perform other actions E.g. Send an event. Currently, an application maps to one endpoint. In the future, an application should map to multiple endpoints. When you creating an application, you should supply a [secret](#secrets).

### Endpoints

An endpoint represents a target URL to receive events. Endpoint can be in either of this states - `active`, `inactive` or `pending`. When an endpoint is in the `inactive` state all events sent will be saved and discarded until the endpoint is brought back up.

### Events

An event represents a specific event triggered by your system. Convoy persists events sent to dead endpoints with a status - `Discarded`. This enables users re-activate their endpoints and easily retry discarded events without the need to re-trigger the events from your systems.

### Delivery Attempts

A delivery attempt represents a single attempt to deliver an event to an endpoint. Specifically, it contains 2 things - Request Headers & Payload, Response Headers & Payload. Convoy records this information for every retry attempt sent. The UI currently shows the last delivery attempt.

### Dead Endpoints

A dead endpoint is an endpoint that failed consecutively to acknowledge events. Currently, we define consecutively failures as at least one event as maxed out it's retry limit to the maximum configured. In the future, we should support different consecutive failure strategies.

### Secrets

Secrets are used to sign the payload when sending events to an endpoint. Creating a secret works as an `upsert` operation. If you don't supply a secret we will generate one for you.

### Hash Functions

Convoy supports the following hash functions - `MD5`, `SHA1`, `SHA224`, `SHA256`, `SHA384`, `SHA512`, `SHA3_224`, `SHA3_256`, `SHA3_384`, `SHA3_512`, `SHA512_224`, `SHA512_256`. Most implementations, however, use - `SHA256` & `SHA512`.

### Replay Attacks
A replay attack occurs when an attacker intercepts a valid network payload with the intent of fraudulently re-transmitting the payload. Convoy supports replay attack prevention by including a timestamp in the request header under the key `Convoy-Timestamp`. This timestamp is also included in the signature-header and is signed together with the request body using the endpoint secret. Therefore, an attacker cannot change the timestamp without invalidating the signature. Take the following steps to verify your signature and prevent replay attacks;

1. Extract the timestamp and the signed signature-header from the request header, extract the request body.
2. Prepare a string by concatenating the timestamp followed by a `,` and the request body.
3. Generate a signature of the concatenated string using the endpoint secret and your hashing algorithm (e.g `SHA256`)
4. Compare the newly generated signature with the value in the signature-header, if the signatures match, check the time interval between the timestamp and the current time. In your system, set a tolerance on this time interval to prevent replay attacks.

## Release

We adopt a time-based release schedule. Convoy releases a new update every 25th of each month. This is a similar pattern adopted by some open-core companies we like i.e. [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/).
