### Installation

To install the package, you will need to be using Composer in your project.

To get started quickly,

```bash
composer require frain/convoy symfony/http-client nyholm/psr7
```

### Setup Client

Next, import the `convoy` module and setup with your auth credentials.

```php
use Convoy\Convoy;

$convoy = new Convoy(["api_key" => "your_api_key"]);
```

The SDK also supports authenticating via Basic Auth by defining your username and password.

```php
$convoy = new Convoy(["username" => "default", "password" => "default"]);
```

In the event you're using a self hosted convoy instance, you can define the url as part of what is passed into convoy's constructor.

```php
$convoy = new Convoy([
    "api_key" => "your_api_key",
    "uri" => "self-hosted-instance"
]);
```

### Creating an Application

An application represents a user's application trying to receive webhooks. Once you create an application, you'll receive a `uid` from the response that you should save and supply in subsequent API calls to perform other requests such as creating an event.

```php
$appData = ["name" => "my_app", "support_email" => "support@myapp.com"];

$response = $convoy->applications()->create($appData);

$appId = $response['data']['uid'];
```

### Add Application Endpoint

After creating an application, you'll need to add an endpoint to the application you just created. An endpoint represents a target URL to receive events.

```php
$endpointData = [
    "url" => "https://0d87-102-89-2-172.ngrok.io",
    "description" => "Default Endpoint",
    "secret" => "endpoint-secret",
    "events" => ["*"]
]

$response = $convoy->endpoints()->create($appId, $endpointData);
```

### Sending an Event

To send an event, you'll need the `uid` from the application we created earlier.

```php
$eventData = [
    "app_id" => $appId,
    "event_type" => "payment.success",
    "data" => [
        "event" => "payment.success",
        "data" => [
            "status" => "Completed",
            "description" => "Transaction Successful",
            "userID" => "test_user_id808"
        ]
    ]
];

$response = $convoy->events()->create($eventData);
```
